name: Challenge!
supertype: Trainer
rules:
- Ask your opponent if he or she accepts your challenge. If your opponent declines
  (or if both Benches are full), draw 2 cards. If your opponent accepts, each of you
  searches your decks for any number of Basic Pok√©mon cards and puts them face down
  onto your Benches. (A player can't do this if his or her Bench is full.) When you
  both have finished, shuffle your decks and turn those cards face up.
